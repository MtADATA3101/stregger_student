## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 is to add a question about GitHub, Git, R, RStudio, or the Bryan (2017) article to the README.md file.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
